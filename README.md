# Airbnb-Database

Reverse-engineered the database of the vacation rental application, [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), which is an online vacation rental marketplace.

* Designed the EER diagram for the database, converted it to a relational schema and normalized it to 3NF
* Created tables, stored procedures and triggers in SQL from the design

**NOTE:** This project does not comprehensively cover all aspects of the application.

*Refer to "Airbnb.pdf" for more details*
